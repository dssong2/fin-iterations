## Screenshot for altitude (to return)
## Change to stability margin graph, export data
## Somehow figure out how to get max stability and the time it happens at from the graph???
    # If get data points or calculations, find max in code
## Find max mach number, store it for use
## Get CNAlpha from the max mach number (to return)
